# hello-world
GWH repository # 1
hi walt. when I try to access your ReadMe Github sends me back this message: 
"You’re making changes in a project you don’t have write access to. We’ve created a fork of this project for you to commit your proposed changes to. Submitting a change will write it to a new branch in your fork, so you can send a pull request."
So I am now going to read about 'Pull Requests' to see how this is supposed to work!
I created a new Repository on my page called ElmerEyeore and added a html file to it that maybe we could use to experiment with collaboration. 
Are you able to access it. I made it PRIVATE so how do I give you permission to access it if you can't already??
